# Raphael is designing something

There's some web stuff to be made, some other Haskell stuff, and some writing
too. He's figuring out what goes where, and rewriting every piece of text until
it seems good enough (staring at blank pages, mostly).

He even played with some watercolor, and sketched some yōkai — But I wouldn't
hold my breath to see something nice, if at all. The lad will figure out soon
enough that he's overdoing it. Take it easy Raph. This is not the Sistine Madonna.

It will all be ok in the end.
